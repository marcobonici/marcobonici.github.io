Since I was a child, I spent a week in [Ahrntal](https://www.ahrntal.com/de/urlaub-im-ahrntal.html),
next to Ã–sterreich. Here I developed a profound passion for mountains
A piece of my heart lies within these mountains, they really mean something to me.

Second big passion: theatre and Stand-Up comedy.

Right after the beginning of my PhD, I started attending an Improvisational Theatre course in Genova, with the
association [Maniman Teatro](http://www.manimanteatro.it/).

Almost at the end of my PhD, while I was $\sout{\text{procrastrinating}}$ writing my PhD
thesis, I started a StandUp Comedy course, led by Annalisa Arione, Daniele Marcori and
[Stefano Gorno](https://www.stefanogorno.it/).

I really love being on stage. I am scientist, I am a selfish person, and acting in front of
a group of people makes me feel alive.
