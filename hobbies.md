I'm a big lover of trekking. I have spent a week in Ahrntal, near to Osterreich, each summer for almost 20 years.
A piece of my heart lies within these mountains, they really mean something to me.

Second big passion: theatre and Stand-Up comedy.
I love it 'cause it is harsh. It is amazing to engage with people while acting, but this come at a price: you need to open up yourself, showing your scars. It can be hard, but it makes me feel alive.
