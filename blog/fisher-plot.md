# FisherPlot.jl: plotting your Fisher posterior contours

[FisherPlot.jl](https://github.com/marcobonici/FisherPlot.jl) is my first registered Julia package. It can be used to easily plot Fisher matrix contours. In the remainder of this post, I'll give a (short) introduction to Fisher matrices, before showing how actually use this package. Cool, isn't it?
