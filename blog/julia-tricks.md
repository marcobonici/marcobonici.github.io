@def title = "Julia tricks"

This page is hidden, for a reason: it is just a list of tricks that I use but that I do not expect to be useful for the general public.

## Installing Julia

Installing `Julia` is easy. You just need to download the following file from the official repository and untar it. After this,
```
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/aarch64/1.9/julia-1.9.3-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
tar zxvf julia-1.9.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

Add Julia to your Path. Open your bashrc
```
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Add to the end the *Absolute* path to Julia, which will look like
```
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/julia-1.9.2/bin"
```
Now source your bashrc
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
You can now start Julia from terminal, using simply
```
julia
```


## Installing Julia kernel on jupyter

Jupyter notebooks are really useful. In order to be able to use them at their best, we must be able to add kernels with our own specifications.

### 1. Create a Julia Environment

The first step requires the creation of a Julia environment.
Let us assume that you are in a `test_environment` folder. You just have to create a new environment.
![create_env](/assets/julia-tricks/create_env.png)
Now you can add all the packages you want!

### 2. Add Jupyter Kernel

The second step requires to use `IJulia` to add your Julia kernel to Jupyter.
```
using IJulia
installkernel("Julia_env nt8", env=Dict("JULIA_NUM_THREADS"=>"8"))
#this will create a kernel using 8 threads
```
![add_kernel](/assets/julia-tricks/add_kernel.png)
More info can be found on the IJulia [Documentation](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/manual/installation/#Installing-additional-Julia-kernels).

## Julia and VSCode

VSCode is a great IDE for Julia, the one I am currently using. What you need, in order to freely add virtual envs to the stuff you are doing, is to add the correct path to your Julia installation, in the Julia extension settings

## Benchmarking

When you want to show benchmark in your website (or in your package documentation), it is useful to perform them _locally_ on your laptop, save the benchmark result and show them (after daclaring which hardware was employed!).

For instance, the benchmark presents on the `Effort.jl` page, have been produced with the following code

```julia
suite = BenchmarkGroup()

suite["Effort"] = BenchmarkGroup(["tag1"])

suite["Effort"]["Monopole"] = @benchmarkable Effort.get_Pâ„“($input_test, $bs, $f, $Mono_Emu)
suite["Effort"]["AP_GK"] = @benchmarkable Effort.apply_AP_check($k_test, $Mono_Effort, $Quad_Effort, $Hexa_Effort,  $q_par, $q_perp)
suite["Effort"]["AP_GL"] = @benchmarkable Effort.apply_AP($k_test, $Mono_Effort, $Quad_Effort, $Hexa_Effort,  $q_par, $q_perp)

tune!(suite)

results = run(suite, verbose = true)

BenchmarkTools.save("effort_benchmark.json", results)
```

In order to see the results, just load the benchmark file and use

```julia
benchmark = BenchmarkTools.load("effort_benchmark.json")

benchmark[1]["Effort"]["AP_GL"]
```

## Distributed computing

### Julia Envs & Distributed computing

If you want to use a Julia environment with distributed computing, it is not enough to start the `julia` REPL or run a script using the `--project` flag: if you add a process, this will use the main `julia` environment.
Remember, when creating processes, that you should pay attention to the env you are using...with the flag `exeflags="--project=$(Base.active_project())"`

## Create Artifact

Largely based on [this](https://github.com/simeonschaub/ArtifactUtils.jl).
This is what we are doing to create the ACTPol lite likelihood.


```julia
using Artifacts, ArtifactUtils, ACTPolLite

tempdir = mktempdir()

npzwrite(joinpath(tempdir,"win_func_d.npy"), win_func_d)
npzwrite(joinpath(tempdir,"win_func_w.npy"), win_func_w)
npzwrite(joinpath(tempdir,"cov_ACT.npy"), cov_ACT)
npzwrite(joinpath(tempdir,"data.npy"), data)

gist = upload_to_gist(artifact_id)

add_artifact!("Artifacts.toml", "DR4_data", gist)
```

In the package, add a function `__init__()` such as

```julia
function __init__()

    global win_func_d = npzread(joinpath(artifact"DR4_data", "win_func_d.npy"))
    global win_func_w = npzread(joinpath(artifact"DR4_data", "win_func_w.npy"))
    global cov_ACT = npzread(joinpath(artifact"DR4_data", "cov_ACT.npy"))
    global data = npzread(joinpath(artifact"DR4_data", "data.npy"))

end
```
