I am a PostDoctoral researcher at [INAF-IASF](https://www.iasf-milano.inaf.it/) in Milano. I am a cosmologist and my research lies in the context of the large-scale-structure of the Universe. I am involved in the [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid_overview) mission of the European Space Agency. Euclid will map the galaxy distribution in about a third of the sky. I am mainly involved in the activity of the Galaxy Clustering Science Working Group (GC-SGW). My main activities regards
- Cosmic Voids. Voids are the biggest large-scale structures of the Universe and can be used as a complementary source of information, increasing the scientific outcome of the Euclid mission. In particular, I am studying the Void-Lensing cross-correlation.
- I am involved, as a core-team member, in the developmentthe official likelihood code of the Euclid consortium, CLOE.
- I am leading a Euclid Key Project which aims at developing techniques to accelerate the inference of cosmological data, using Deep Learning and Computer Science techniques. By the way, this project in entirely coded in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/).
